What are some things we can do to energize our ministry?

Why may it be important to evaluate our efforts in the ministry?
=================================================================

Refine my innermost thoughts* and my heart.

Discuss
--------
- How can we evaluate our efforts in the ministry?
- What can help us determine what is realistic?
- How often should we evaluate our situation? Why?

Application
---------------
What will assist us in determining what is realistic for ourselves? We can ask Jehovah to help us to see our situation objectively. (Ps. 26:2) A trusted, mature Christian friend who knows us well and who is not afraid to tell us whether we need to improve may also be of assistance. (Prov. 27:9)[^prov-27-9] Remember, too, that since circumstances change, it is beneficial to evaluate our situation regularly.—Eph. 5:10[^eph-5-10].

_**Reference** km 7/10 p. 2 Am I Doing Enough?_
 
[^prov-27-9]: **Proverbs 27:9** Oil and incense make the heart rejoice; So does sweet friendship springing from sincere counsel.
[^eph-5-10]: **Ephesians 5:10** Keep on making sure of what is acceptable+ to the Lord;


What are the benefits of being more than a silent partner in the ministry?
===========================================================================

**Proverbs 27:17** As iron sharpens iron, So one man sharpens his friend.

Discuss
--------
- What can we share with our partner that may help him become more effective in his ministry?
- How does sharing help with their confidence?

Application
-------------
Share Methods: Have you found a simple opening statement or question, perhaps something about a local event, to be effective in starting a conversation? Have you experienced good results from adding a personal touch to a sample presentation? Tell your partner. (Prov. 27:17) While traveling to a return visit, you can relate your objective for the visit and how you plan to achieve it. After a Bible study, you could explain why you chose a certain point, scripture, or teaching method to address the student’s needs.
