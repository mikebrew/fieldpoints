<h1 id="why-may-it-be-important-to-evaluate-our-efforts-in-the-ministry">Why may it be important to evaluate our efforts in the ministry?</h1>
<p><strong>Psalms 26:2</strong> Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; Refine my innermost thoughts* and my heart.</p>
<h2 id="discuss-1">Discuss</h2>
<ul>
<li>How can we evaluate our efforts in the ministry?</li>
<li>What can help us determine what is realistic?</li>
<li>How often should we evaluate our situation? Why?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="application-1">Application</h2>
<p>What will assist us in determining what is realistic for ourselves? We can ask Jehovah to help us to see our situation objectively. (Ps. 26:2) A trusted, mature Christian friend who knows us well and who is not afraid to tell us whether we need to improve may also be of assistance. (Prov. 27:9)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Remember, too, that since circumstances change, it is beneficial to evaluate our situation regularly.—Eph. 5:10<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reference</strong> km 7/10 p. 2 Am I Doing Enough?</em></p>
<h1 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-being-more-than-a-silent-partner-in-the-ministry">What are the benefits of being more than a silent partner in the ministry?</h1>
<p><strong>Proverbs 27:17</strong> As iron sharpens iron, So one man sharpens his friend.</p>
<h2 id="discuss-2">Discuss</h2>
<ul>
<li>What can we share with our partner that may help him become more effective in his ministry?</li>
<li>How does sharing help with their confidence?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="application-2">Application</h2>
<p>Share Methods: Have you found a simple opening statement or question, perhaps something about a local event, to be effective in starting a conversation? Have you experienced good results from adding a personal touch to a sample presentation? Tell your partner. (Prov. 27:17) While traveling to a return visit, you can relate your objective for the visit and how you plan to achieve it. After a Bible study, you could explain why you chose a certain point, scripture, or teaching method to address the student’s needs.</p>
